All types of maintenance and construction vehicles are covered, including heavy equipment, supervisory vehicles, unmanned remote controlled field maintenance robots, and sensory platforms that may be wheeled or low altitude aerial vehicles (e.g. drones, balloons). The MCV OBE provides two-way communications between drivers\/operators and dispatchers and maintains and communicates current location and status information. A wide range of operational status is monitored, measured, and made available, depending on the specific type of vehicle or equipment. A snow plow for example, would monitor whether the plow is up or down and material usage information. The Maint and Constr Vehicle OBE may also contain capabilities to monitor vehicle systems to support maintenance of the vehicle itself.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

It provides the vehicle-based general sensory, processing, storage, and communications functions that support efficient, safe, and convenient travel. Many of these capabilities (e.g., see the Vehicle Safety service packages) apply to all vehicle types including personal vehicles, commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit vehicles, and maintenance vehicles. From this perspective, the Vehicle includes the common interfaces and functions that apply to all motorized vehicles. The radio(s) supporting V2V and V2I communications are a key component of the Vehicle. Both one-way and two-way communications options support a spectrum of information services from basic broadcast to advanced personalized information services. Advanced sensors, processors, enhanced driver interfaces, and actuators complement the driver information services so that, in addition to making informed mode and route selections, the driver travels these routes in a safer and more consistent manner. This physical object supports all six levels of driving automation as defined in SAE J3016. Initial collision avoidance functions provide 'vigilant co-pilot' driver warning capabilities. More advanced functions assume limited control of the vehicle to maintain lane position and safe headways. In the most advanced implementations, this Physical Object supports full automation of all aspects of the driving task, aided by communications with other vehicles in the vicinity and in coordination with supporting infrastructure subsystems.\n\n\tFunction-0: The  'Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application' monitors and reports its own operating parameters and communicates with roadside equipment to safely enter, operate within, and exit restricted lanes that are relevant to all types of vehicles.\n\tFunction-1:'Vehicle Basic Safety Communication' exchanges current vehicle characteristics, location, and motion (including past and intended maneuver) information with other vehicles in the vicinity, uses that information to calculate vehicle paths, and warns the driver when the potential for an impending collision is detected.

It includes the vehicle platform that interfaces with and hosts ITS electronics and all of the driver convenience and entertainment systems, and other non-ITS electronics on-board the vehicle. Interfaces represent both internal on-board interfaces between ITS equipment and other vehicle systems and other passive and active external interfaces or views of the vehicle that support vehicle\/traffic monitoring and management. External interfaces may also represent equipment that is carried into the vehicle (e.g., a smartphone that is brought into the vehicle). Internal interfaces are often implemented through a vehicle databus, which is also included in this object. Note that 'Vehicle' represents the general functions and interfaces that are associated with personal automobiles as well as commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit vehicles, and other specialized vehicles.\n\nDescription of the Acceptor:\nThis 'Vehicle' physical object is used to model core capabilities that are common to more than one type of Vehicle. It provides the vehicle-based general sensory, processing, storage, and communications functions that support efficient, safe, and convenient travel. Many of these capabilities (e.g., see the Vehicle Safety service packages) apply to all vehicle types including personal vehicles, commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit vehicles, and maintenance vehicles. From this perspective, the Vehicle includes the common interfaces and functions that apply to all motorized vehicles. The radio(s) supporting V2V and V2I communications are a key component of the Vehicle. Both one-way and two-way communications options support a spectrum of information services from basic broadcast to advanced personalized information services. Advanced sensors, processors, enhanced driver interfaces, and actuators complement the driver information services so that, in addition to making informed mode and route selections, the driver travels these routes in a safer and more consistent manner. This physical object supports all six levels of driving automation as defined in SAE J3016. Initial collision avoidance functions provide 'vigilant co-pilot' driver warning capabilities. More advanced functions assume limited control of the vehicle to maintain lane position and safe headways. In the most advanced implementations, this Physical Object supports full automation of all aspects of the driving task, aided by communications with other vehicles in the vicinity and in coordination with supporting infrastructure subsystems.\n\n\tFunction-0: The  'Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application' monitors and reports its own operating parameters and communicates with roadside equipment to safely enter, operate within, and exit restricted lanes that are relevant to all types of vehicles.\n\tFunction-1:  'Vehicle Basic Safety Communication' exchanges current vehicle characteristics, location, and motion (including past and intended maneuver) information with other vehicles in the vicinity, uses that information to calculate vehicle paths, and warns the driver when the potential for an impending collision is detected. If available, map data is used to filter and interpret the relative location and motion of vehicles in the vicinity. Information from on-board sensors (e.g., radars and image processing) are also used, if available, in combination with the V2V communications to detect non-equipped vehicles and corroborate connected vehicle data. This object represents a broad range of implementations ranging from basic Vehicle Awareness Devices that only broadcast vehicle location and motion and provide no driver warnings to advanced integrated safety systems that coordinate maneuvers and may, in addition to warning the driver, provide collision warning information to support automated control functions that can support control intervention.\n\nDefinition of host_vehicle_status information flow:\nInformation provided to the ITS on-board equipment from other systems on the vehicle platform. This includes the current status of the powertrain, steering, and braking systems, and status of other safety and convenience systems. In implementations where GPS is not integrated into the Vehicle On-Board Equipment, the host vehicle is also the source for data describing the vehicle's location in three dimensions (latitude, longitude, elevation) and accurate time that can be used for time synchronization across the ITS environment.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow:\nThreat Title:Potential Lack of Input Validation for Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application;Threat Category:Tampering;Description:Data flowing across Basic Vehicle- Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application: (1A) host vehicle status + driver input information may be tampered with by an attacker.

It includes a processor, data storage, and communications capabilities that support secure communications with passing vehicles, other field equipment, and centers.\n\n\tFunction-0: The  'RSE Restricted Lanes Application' uses short range communications to monitor and manage dynamic and static restricted lanes. It collects vehicle profile information from vehicles entering the lanes and monitors vehicles within the lanes, providing aggregate data to the back office center. It provides lane restriction information and signage data to the vehicles and optionally identifies vehicles that violate the current lane restrictions. These functions are performed based on operating parameters provided by the back office managing center(s).\n\nDefinition of restricted_lanes_application_info information flow:\nRestricted lane application configuration data and messaging parameters.

It manages traffic and transportation resources to support allied agencies in responding to, and recovering from, incidents ranging from minor traffic incidents through major disasters.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'TMC Restricted Lanes CV Application' manages dynamic lanes for connected vehicles. The application provides the back office functions and supports the TMC operator in establishing and managing dynamic lanes using communications to manage lane use for connected vehicles.\n\nDescription of the Acceptor:\nThe 'Transportation Information Center' collects, processes, stores, and disseminates transportation information to system operators and the traveling public. The physical object can play several different roles in an integrated ITS. In one role, the TIC provides a data collection, fusing, and repackaging function, collecting information from transportation system operators and redistributing this information to other system operators in the region and other TICs. In this information redistribution role, the TIC provides a bridge between the various transportation systems that produce the information and the other TICs and their subscribers that use the information. The second role of a TIC is focused on delivery of traveler information to subscribers and the public at large. Information provided includes basic advisories, traffic and road conditions, transit schedule information, yellow pages information, ride matching information, and parking information. The TIC is commonly implemented as a website or a web-based application service, but it represents any traveler information distribution service.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'TIC Traffic Control Dissemination' disseminates intersection status, lane control information, special vehicle alerts, and other traffic control related information that is real-time or near real-time in nature and relevant to vehicles in a relatively local area on the road network. It collects traffic control information from Traffic Management and other Center(s) and disseminates the relevant information to vehicles and other mobile devices.\n\nDefinition of restricted_lanes_information information flow:\nThis flow defines the location, duration, and operating parameters for lanes that are reserved for the exclusive use of certain types of vehicles (e.g., transit vehicles) or vehicles that meet other qualifications (e.g., number of occupants, low emissions criteria). It identifies the lane(s), the start and stop locations, start and end times, vehicle restrictions, speed limits and platooning parameters.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow:\nThreat Title:Potential Data Repudiation by Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application;Threat Category:Repudiation;Description:Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.;\nThreat Title:Data Flow Sniffing;Threat Category:Information Disclosure;Description:Data flowing across TMC Restricted Lanes CV Application- Enforcement Center: (2C) restricted lanes information may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.;\nThreat Title:Potential Lack of Input Validation for Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application;Threat Category:Tampering;Description:Data flowing across TMC Restricted Lanes CV Application- Enforcement Center: (2C) restricted lanes information may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application or an elevation of privilege attack against Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application or an information disclosure by Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

It provides the capability for vehicle operators to pay tolls without stopping their vehicles. It supports use of locally determined pricing structures and includes the capability to implement various variable pricing policies. Typically, transactions are accompanied by feedback to the customer and a record of the transactions is provided to a back office system (e.g., the Payment Administration Center).\n\n\tFunction-0:  'Roadway Toll Collection Support' provides toll plazas the capability to identify properly equipped vehicles, collect electronic tolls, and provide a positive indication to the driver that a toll was collected. Violators are identified and images are collected. Toll transactions are stored and reported to the Payment Administration Center.\n\nDescription of the Acceptor:\nThe 'Payment Administration Center' provides general payment administration capabilities and supports the electronic transfer of funds from the customer to the transportation system operator or other service provider. Charges can be recorded for tolls, vehicle-mileage charging, congestion charging, or other goods and services. It supports traveler enrollment and collection of both pre-payment and post-payment transportation fees in coordination with the financial infrastructure supporting electronic payment transactions. The system may establish and administer escrow accounts depending on the clearinghouse scheme and the type of payments involved. It may post a transaction to the customer account, generate a bill (for post-payment accounts), debit an escrow account, or interface to a financial infrastructure to debit a customer designated account. It supports communications with the ITS Roadway Payment Equipment to support fee collection operations. As an alternative, a wide-area wireless interface can be used to communicate directly with vehicle equipment. It also sets and administers the pricing structures and may implement road pricing policies in coordination with the Traffic Management Center.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'PAC Payment Administration' provides administration and management of payments associated with electronic toll collection, parking payments, and other e-payments. It provides the back office functions that support enrollment, pricing, reduced fare eligibility, payment reconciliation with financial institutions, and violation notification to enforcement agencies. It also supports dynamic pricing to support demand management, allow\/block-list management and token validation.\n\tFunction-1: 'PAC Road Pricing Administration' enables payment for road use based on VMT, vehicle type, vehicle emissions, or other parameters. It establishes a price schedule based on these parameters that may vary by time, location or zone, vehicle type, and\/or vehicle behavior. Pricing strategies may also include incentives that allow reimbursement of fees previously paid for good behavior (e.g., VMT reductions, economical driving behavior, avoidance of peak periods or congested zones). It receives vehicle data (e.g., time stamped roadways used by the vehicle since the last transmission) and computes the total cost to the vehicle owner for payment. Based on owner preference, this cost is either billed to the owner or requested from an in-vehicle payment instrument. Payment for use of roadways not operated by the specific instance of the VMT Payment Administration that the vehicle is registered with, will be reconciled. Payment violations can be reported to Enforcement Agencies when appropriate. Finally, vehicle owners can interact with this object using personal devices or public terminals to setup and edit account preferences for owned vehicles, get account reports, and make payments.\n\nDefinition of authorization_request information flow:\nRequest to determine if a transportation user is authorized to use a particular transportation resource.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow:\nThreat Title:Elevation Using Impersonation;Threat Category:Elevation Of Privilege;Description:PAC Payment Administration may be able to impersonate the context of Transit Vehicle on-board fare management in order to gain additional privilege.;\nThreat Title:Authenticated Data Flow Compromised;Threat Category:Tampering;Description:An attacker can read or modify data transmitted over an authenticated dataflow.;\nThreat Title:Potential Lack of Input Validation for PAC Payment Administration;Threat Category:Tampering;Description:Data flowing across Transit Vehicle on-board fare management- PAC Payment Administration: (2C) authorization request may be tampered with by an attacker.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In this information redistribution role, the TIC provides a bridge between the various transportation systems that produce the information and the other TICs and their subscribers that use the information. The second role of a TIC is focused on delivery of traveler information to subscribers and the public at large. Information provided includes basic advisories, traffic and road conditions, transit schedule information, yellow pages information, ride matching information, and parking information. The TIC is commonly implemented as a website or a web-based application service, but it represents any traveler information distribution service.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'TIC Data Collection' collects transportation-related data from other centers, performs data quality checks on the collected data and then consolidates, verifies, and refines the data and makes it available in a consistent format to applications that support operational data sharing between centers and deliver traveler information to end-users. A broad range of data is collected including traffic and road conditions, transit data, emergency information and advisories, weather data, special event information, traveler services, parking, multimodal data, and toll\/pricing data. It also shares data with other transportation information centers.\n\nDefinition of transit_fare_information information flow:\nInformation provided by transit management that supports fare payment transactions.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow: \nThreat Title:Cross Site Request Forgery;Threat Category:Elevation Of Privilege;Description:Cross-site request forgery (CSRF or XSRF) is a type of attack in which an attacker forces a user's browser to make a forged request to a vulnerable site by exploiting an existing trust relationship between the browser and the vulnerable web site.  In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations.\n\nThreat Title:Elevation by Changing the Execution Flow in TIC Data Collection;Threat Category:Elevation Of Privilege;Description:An attacker may pass data into TIC Data Collection in order to change the flow of program execution within TIC Data Collection to the attacker's choosing.\nThreat Title:TIC Data Collection May be Subject to Elevation of Privilege Using Remote Code Execution;Threat Category:Elevation Of Privilege;Description:Transit Center Fare Management may be able to remotely execute code for TIC Data Collection.\n\nThreat Title:Elevation Using Impersonation;Threat Category:Elevation Of Privilege;Description:TIC Data Collection may be able to impersonate the context of Transit Center Fare Management in order to gain additional privilege.\n\nThreat Title:Data Flow transit fare information Is Potentially Interrupted;Threat Category:Denial Of Service;Description:An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.\n\nThreat Title:Potential Process Crash or Stop for TIC Data Collection;Threat Category:Denial Of Service;Description:TIC Data Collection crashes, halts, stops or runs slowly; in all cases violating an availability metric.\n\nThreat Title:Data Flow Sniffing;Threat Category:Information Disclosure;Description:Data flowing across transit_fare_information may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow.\n\nThreat Title:Potential Data Repudiation by TIC Data Collection;Threat Category:Repudiation;Description:TIC Data Collection claims that it did not receive data from a source outside the trust boundary. Consider using logging or auditing to record the source, time, and summary of the received data.\n\nThreat Title:Potential Lack of Input Validation for TIC Data Collection;Threat Category:Tampering;Description:Data flowing across transit_fare_information may be tampered with by an attacker. This may lead to a denial of service attack against TIC Data Collection or an elevation of privilege attack against TIC Data Collection or an information disclosure by TIC Data Collection. Failure to verify that input is as expected is a root cause of a very large number of exploitable issues. Consider all paths and the way they handle data. Verify that all input is verified for correctness using an approved list input validation approach.\n\nThreat Title:Spoofing the TIC Data Collection Process;Threat Category:Spoofing;Description:TIC Data Collection may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to information disclosure by Transit Center Fare Management. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the destination process.\n\nThreat Title:Spoofing the Transit Center Fare Management Process;Threat Category:Spoofing;Description:Transit Center Fare Management may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to unauthorized access to TIC Data Collection. Consider using a standard authentication mechanism to identify the source process."}

The physical object can play several different roles in an integrated ITS. In one role, the TIC provides a data collection, fusing, and repackaging function, collecting information from transportation system operators and redistributing this information to other system operators in the region and other TICs. In this information redistribution role, the TIC provides a bridge between the various transportation systems that produce the information and the other TICs and their subscribers that use the information. The second role of a TIC is focused on delivery of traveler information to subscribers and the public at large. Information provided includes basic advisories, traffic and road conditions, transit schedule information, yellow pages information, ride matching information, and parking information. The TIC is commonly implemented as a website or a web-based application service, but it represents any traveler information distribution service.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'TIC Data Collection' collects transportation-related data from other centers, performs data quality checks on the collected data and then consolidates, verifies, and refines the data and makes it available in a consistent format to applications that support operational data sharing between centers and deliver traveler information to end-users.

Traveler information access points include kiosks and informational displays supporting varied levels of interaction and information access. At transit stops this might be simple displays providing schedule information and imminent arrival signals. This may be extended to include multi-modal information including traffic conditions and transit schedules to support mode and route selection at major trip generation sites. Personalized route planning and route guidance information can also be provided based on criteria supplied by the traveler. It also supports service enrollment and electronic payment of transit fares. In addition to the traveler information provision, it also enhances security in public areas by supporting traveler activated silent alarms.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'Traveler Information Reception' receives formatted traffic advisories, road conditions, transit information, broadcast alerts, and other general traveler information broadcasts and presents the information to the traveler with a public traveler interface. It includes the receiver and public display device such as a large display monitor or other public display.\n\nDescription of the Acceptor:\nThe 'Traveler' represents any individual who uses transportation services. The interfaces to the traveler provide general pre-trip and en-route information supporting trip planning, personal guidance, and requests for assistance in an emergency that are relevant to all transportation system users. It also represents users of a public transportation system and addresses interfaces these users have within a transit vehicle or at transit facilities such as roadside stops and transit centers.\n\nDefinition of traveler_interface_updates information flow:\nVisual or audio information (e.g., routes, messages, guidance, emergency information) that is provided to the traveler.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow:\n\n\nThreat Title:Data Flow traveler interface updates Is Potentially Interrupted;Threat Category:Denial Of Service;Description:An external agent interrupts data flowing across a trust boundary in either direction.;\nThreat Title:External Entity Traveler Potentially Denies Receiving Data;Threat Category:Repudiation;Description:Traveler claims that it did not receive data from a process on the other side of the trust boundary.

The physical object can play several different roles in an integrated ITS. In one role, the TIC provides a data collection, fusing, and repackaging function, collecting information from transportation system operators and redistributing this information to other system operators in the region and other TICs. In this information redistribution role, the TIC provides a bridge between the various transportation systems that produce the information and the other TICs and their subscribers that use the information. The second role of a TIC is focused on delivery of traveler information to subscribers and the public at large. Information provided includes basic advisories, traffic and road conditions, transit schedule information, yellow pages information, ride matching information, and parking information. The TIC is commonly implemented as a website or a web-based application service, but it represents any traveler information distribution service.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'TIC Emergency Traveler Information' provides emergency information to the public, including wide-area alerts and evacuation information. It provides emergency alerts, information on evacuation zones and evacuation requirements, evacuation destinations and shelter information, available transportation modes, and traffic and road conditions at the origin, destination, and along the evacuation routes. In addition to general evacuation information, personalized information including tailored evacuation routes, service information, and estimated travel times is also provided based on traveler specified origin, destination, and route parameters. Updated information is provided throughout the evacuation and subsequent reentry as status changes and plans are adapted.\n\nDefinition of evacuation_assistance_request information flow:\nA request for evacuation assistance, which may be registered in advance or issued during an evacuation.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS. See the Forgery Protection property on the flow stencil for a list of mitigations."}

It includes the vehicle platform that interfaces with and hosts ITS electronics and all of the driver convenience and entertainment systems, and other non-ITS electronics on-board the vehicle. Interfaces represent both internal on-board interfaces between ITS equipment and other vehicle systems and other passive and active external interfaces or views of the vehicle that support vehicle\/traffic monitoring and management. External interfaces may also represent equipment that is carried into the vehicle (e.g., a smartphone that is brought into the vehicle). Internal interfaces are often implemented through a vehicle databus, which is also included in this object. Note that 'Vehicle' represents the general functions and interfaces that are associated with personal automobiles as well as commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit vehicles, and other specialized vehicles.\n\nDescription of the Acceptor:\nThis 'Vehicle' physical object is used to model core capabilities that are common to more than one type of Vehicle. It provides the vehicle-based general sensory, processing, storage, and communications functions that support efficient, safe, and convenient travel. Many of these capabilities (e.g., see the Vehicle Safety service packages) apply to all vehicle types including personal vehicles, commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit vehicles, and maintenance vehicles. From this perspective, the Vehicle includes the common interfaces and functions that apply to all motorized vehicles. The radio(s) supporting V2V and V2I communications are a key component of the Vehicle. Both one-way and two-way communications options support a spectrum of information services from basic broadcast to advanced personalized information services. Advanced sensors, processors, enhanced driver interfaces, and actuators complement the driver information services so that, in addition to making informed mode and route selections, the driver travels these routes in a safer and more consistent manner. This physical object supports all six levels of driving automation as defined in SAE J3016. Initial collision avoidance functions provide 'vigilant co-pilot' driver warning capabilities. More advanced functions assume limited control of the vehicle to maintain lane position and safe headways. In the most advanced implementations, this Physical Object supports full automation of all aspects of the driving task, aided by communications with other vehicles in the vicinity and in coordination with supporting infrastructure subsystems.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'Vehicle Basic Safety Communication' exchanges current vehicle characteristics, location, and motion (including past and intended maneuver) information with other vehicles in the vicinity, uses that information to calculate vehicle paths, and warns the driver when the potential for an impending collision is detected. If available, map data is used to filter and interpret the relative location and motion of vehicles in the vicinity. Information from on-board sensors (e.g., radars and image processing) are also used, if available, in combination with the V2V communications to detect non-equipped vehicles and corroborate connected vehicle data. This object represents a broad range of implementations ranging from basic Vehicle Awareness Devices that only broadcast vehicle location and motion and provide no driver warnings to advanced integrated safety systems that coordinate maneuvers and may, in addition to warning the driver, provide collision warning information to support automated control functions that can support control intervention.\n\nDefinition of driver_input_information information flow:\nDriver input received from the driver-vehicle interface equipment via the vehicle bus.

In this information redistribution role, the TIC provides a bridge between the various transportation systems that produce the information and the other TICs and their subscribers that use the information. The second role of a TIC is focused on delivery of traveler information to subscribers and the public at large. Information provided includes basic advisories, traffic and road conditions, transit schedule information, yellow pages information, ride matching information, and parking information. The TIC is commonly implemented as a website or a web-based application service, but it represents any traveler information distribution service.\n\n\tFunction-0:  'TIC Data Collection' collects transportation-related data from other centers, performs data quality checks on the collected data and then consolidates, verifies, and refines the data and makes it available in a consistent format to applications that support operational data sharing between centers and deliver traveler information to end-users. A broad range of data is collected including traffic and road conditions, transit data, emergency information and advisories, weather data, special event information, traveler services, parking, multimodal data, and toll\/pricing data. It also shares data with other transportation information centers.\n\nDefinition of traveler_sourced_updates information flow:\nTraveler posts on traffic and road conditions, parking availability, transit services, traveler services, shelter information, hazards, debris, obstacles, and other real-time crowd-sourced data that may be shared with other travelers.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow:\nThreat Title:Data Flow Sniffing;Threat Category:Information Disclosure;Description:Data flowing across traveler sourced updates may be sniffed by an attacker. Depending on what type of data an attacker can read, it may be used to attack other parts of the system or simply be a disclosure of information leading to compliance violations. Consider encrypting the data flow."}

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting etc.  The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

It provides the vehicle-based general sensory, processing, storage, and communications functions that support efficient, safe, and convenient travel. Many of these capabilities (e.g., see the Vehicle Safety service packages) apply to all vehicle types including personal vehicles, commercial vehicles, emergency vehicles, transit vehicles, and maintenance vehicles. From this perspective, the Vehicle includes the common interfaces and functions that apply to all motorized vehicles. The radio(s) supporting V2V and V2I communications are a key component of the Vehicle. Both one-way and two-way communications options support a spectrum of information services from basic broadcast to advanced personalized information services. Advanced sensors, processors, enhanced driver interfaces, and actuators complement the driver information services so that, in addition to making informed mode and route selections, the driver travels these routes in a safer and more consistent manner. This physical object supports all six levels of driving automation as defined in SAE J3016. Initial collision avoidance functions provide 'vigilant co-pilot' driver warning capabilities. More advanced functions assume limited control of the vehicle to maintain lane position and safe headways. In the most advanced implementations, this Physical Object supports full automation of all aspects of the driving task, aided by communications with other vehicles in the vicinity and in coordination with supporting infrastructure subsystems.\n\n\tFunction-0: The  'Vehicle Restricted Lanes Application' monitors and reports its own operating parameters and communicates with roadside equipment to safely enter, operate within, and exit restricted lanes that are relevant to all types of vehicles.\n\tFunction-1:  'Vehicle Basic Safety Communication' exchanges current vehicle characteristics, location, and motion (including past and intended maneuver) information with other vehicles in the vicinity, uses that information to calculate vehicle paths, and warns the driver when the potential for an impending collision is detected. If available, map data is used to filter and interpret the relative location and motion of vehicles in the vicinity. Information from on-board sensors (e.g., radars and image processing) are also used, if available, in combination with the V2V communications to detect non-equipped vehicles and corroborate connected vehicle data. This object represents a broad range of implementations ranging from basic Vehicle Awareness Devices that only broadcast vehicle location and motion and provide no driver warnings to advanced integrated safety systems that coordinate maneuvers and may, in addition to warning the driver, provide collision warning information to support automated control functions that can support control intervention.\n\nDescription of the Acceptor:\nThe 'Driver' represents the person that operates a vehicle on the roadway. Included are operators of private, transit, commercial, and emergency vehicles where the interactions are not particular to the type of vehicle (e.g., interactions supporting vehicle safety applications). The Driver originates driver requests and receives driver information that reflects the interactions which might be useful to all drivers, regardless of vehicle classification. Information and interactions which are unique to drivers of a specific vehicle type (e.g., fleet interactions with transit, commercial, or emergency vehicle drivers) are covered by separate objects.\n\nDefinition of driver_updates information flow:\nInformation provided to the driver including visual displays, audible information and warnings, and haptic feedback. The updates inform the driver about current conditions, potential hazards, and the current status of vehicle on-board equipment.\n\nSTRIDE based threat information associated with the information flow:\nThreat Title:Spoofing of the Driver External Destination Entity;Threat Category:Spoofing;Description:Driver may be spoofed by an attacker and this may lead to data being sent to the attacker's target instead of Driver.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit. The issue can only be resolved on the server side by requiring that all authenticated state-changing requests include an additional piece of secret payload (canary or CSRF token) which is known only to the legitimate web site and the browser and which is protected in transit through SSL\/TLS.

In a simple scenario, a user is logged in to web site A using a cookie as a credential.  The other browses to web site B.  Web site B returns a page with a hidden form that posts to web site A.  Since the browser will carry the user's cookie to web site A, web site B now can take any action on web site A, for example, adding an admin to an account.  The attack can be used to exploit any requests that the browser automatically authenticates, e.g. by session cookie, integrated authentication, IP whitelisting. The attack can be carried out in many ways such as by luring the victim to a site under control of the attacker, getting the user to click a link in a phishing email, or hacking a reputable web site that the victim will visit.
